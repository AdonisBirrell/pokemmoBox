## ‚ú® What are the main features of the website? <a id="tools"></a>

1. **Item Prices and Investments** <a id="tools-0"></a>

Know the current item prices, stay informed and in control of your investments. View detailed price and volume charts for any item, allowing you to analyze trends, identify potential opportunities, and make good decisions.

Save your investments to a dedicated watchlist for easy monitoring. Never lose track of an item's price again ‚Äì get a clear picture of its history and stay ahead of the curve.

2. **Breeding Simulator** <a id="tools-1"></a>

Set how many IVs you want on a Pok√©mon and if you want to consider the nature on it too. The website will calculate how many Pok√©mon you need for that breeding and will split them in groups. 

You must give an IV to every group and you'll get a graph with every breed and the final result on it. 

3. **Pokedex** <a id="tools-2"></a>

A Pok√©dex but with PokeMMO in mind. The Pok√©mon list doesn't every piece of information out there, for that there are better sites like https://pokemondb.net. 

Filter the Pok√©mon by egg groups, routes, horde etc. You can also click on the buttons in the search bar to activate the hidden tab in the whole Pok√©dex.

1. **Egg Moves Calculator** <a id="tools-3"></a>

This feature is pretty easy to explain but come handy in a lot of situations. You just have to select the Pok√©mon you want information for, select the egg move you want to get and the tool will calculate all the required breedings. 

5. **Cosmetics Helper** <a id="tools-4"></a>

This feature is easy to explain too. Just a collection of every cosmetics available in the game. You can try them on the fly and see how different set matches together. You can also select the follower Pok√©mon and if you want it to be shiny or not. 
You do not have to buy all the cosmetics in game just to check how they match together now. 

1. **Quick info sections** <a id="tools-5"></a>

A section, available on the main page, which list all the quick info which a newbie could need. For example, a calculator of Rich charm, just to check how much you gain using it, and the level cap for every region.
